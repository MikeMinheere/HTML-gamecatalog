                    <h2>GTFO</h2>
                    <p>Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by The Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown. GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience.</p>

                <h2>Reviews</h2>
                <p><strong>Efrakys:</strong> This game is schizo Deep Rock Galactic and you can't change my mind</p>
                <p><strong>Scrix:</strong> This game makes u realize how stupid some of your friends are.</p>
                <p><strong>Meat Schackles:</strong> With the 1.0 update I would now wholly recommend this game. With the 1.0 update you now have bots available making the game playable fully solo and the communications system has been improved a lot with callout functions for both controlling the bots and for use in multiplayer. All the new weapons and customization that came with the update are great as well. If you were hesitant to get this before because you heard you needed a group to play with or that you needed a mic to play that is no longer the case.</p>
